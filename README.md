# Human-Based-AvaPrediction
An app that will predict and monitor the vitals of a human being right before entering an avalanche and alert the needful authorities.

### Our Dashboard

___

The software will be enabled in the base station and then soldiers/ppl will be contacted through a radio jockey. This software will be able to show the predictions of an avalanche made by our radar and display it to people at the base camp to keep a check on the mountaineer's real time vitals, health and location with accuracy.

FEATURES:
The dashboard includes a left panel which shows the number of people connected with software with their respective vitals. 
The icons of each of these people are colour-theorised to show whether the person is in safe zone or not.
